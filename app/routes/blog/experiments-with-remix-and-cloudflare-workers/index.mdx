# All about those cookies.
The first time you fetched this page, you started a new session and 1 of 2 possible cookie value pairs were randomly chosen wihtin a Cloudflare Worker.
**I didn't ask for your consent to accept cookies, but I'm not storing them. Here are the values.**

These are hexidecimal values used to lookup contracts on Ethereum.
> 1. `contract=0xd5dfb159788856f9fd5f897509d5a68b7b571ea8&tokenId=0x0e89341c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004`
> 2. `contract=0xD5Dfb159788856f9fd5F897509d5a68b7b571Ea8&tokenId=0x0e89341c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009`

The value pair was then used to send a request to a dedicated Ethereum gateway, Infura. 
Once the request to Infura was complete, the Cloudflare Worker injected the contract meta data response into the markup and sent it back to you along with the cookie value.
*I could have passed the values to you and made you use your client side Ethereum provider, but browser wallets are a UX nightmare.*

 Check out which NFT was randomly chosen to be displayed!
> 1. When you refresh the page, the same NFT will be displayed.
> 2. When you click on the other option, you send a form request back to the server that sets your cookie and returns the appropriate metadata.
