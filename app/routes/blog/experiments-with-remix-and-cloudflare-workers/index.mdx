# Remix might be more than a framework flavor of the month.
Web developers are constantly inundated with new tools to adopt.
Sometimes, they offer slightly more efficient ways of building things, but at a high cost of time and effort.
It's at this point when a developer asks themselves, what features does it provide and how steep is the learning curve?

## What's the value proposition?
This is what I thought to myself when I first found out about the Remix React framework.
What does Remix offer that can't already be accomplished with my existing toolset? 

_Server-Side Rendering_

After building and maintaining single page applications I have grown to miss server side functionality for front-end logic.
Also, SSR can do pretty much everything that CSR can do, but not the other way around.

> An overview of different rendering methods
>
> **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)** Also known as a SPA (Single Page Application), is a bundle of code served from one location. 
> Applications are compiled into bundles in advanced and are then served from a location.
> A page request that loads a SPA returns a relatively large bundle of javascript. The client then renders the page once it receives the minimum amount of code required.
> This means slow initial load times, but subsequent user actions are snappy.
> The other downside is that reconfiguring the application requires rebuilding.
>
> **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** When an application is server side rendered, each request is compiled JIT and the result is returned in the reponse.
> This means that the server can dynamically inject or render the page based on the request parameters, session state, cookie values and authentication.
> Additionally, initial first paints to the client happen much quicker than with a SPA
> This is nice, but it requires hosting your application on a VM or server. Which means you will be paying your cloud provider for server hosting.
> There are many strategies and solutions out there to optimize server cost through dynamic scaling and vm orchestration (such as Kubernetes), but they are very complex.
>
> **SSG (Static Site Generation)** This is sort of similar to SSR, however each page is pre rendered at build time. 
> Helps reduce server costs, but removes the dynamic capabilities that SSR offers.
>
> **ESSR (Edge Server Side Rendering)** This is the new kid on the block. It is essentially the same as SSR except, without a dedicated server. 
> Instead of running an application on a server waiting for requests, each route is defined as a serverless function. 
> When a request is made to a route, a serverless function is invoked and the request can be handled _server side_ so to speak. 
> What you end up with is a cheaper alternative to SSR.

Server side rendering is definitely worth learning, but there are other SSR React frameworks, so why Remix? 

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) has been around for longer and is a great framework.
However, at this time Next.js only supports SSR and SSG.

[Flareact](https://flareact.com/docs/getting-started) is another interesting option.
It was created by CloudFlare and is designed to be an ESSR framework. It looks alot like Next.js, but it is very new and has limited community resources.

Remix has some powerful features that sets it apart from Next.js and Flareact.
- **Nested Routes** - By far one of the coolest features. Each route is its own component. The component name is the route and the directory is the path.
  ```
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 404.js
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contact.js
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ invoices
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ $id.edit.js
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ $id.js
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ late.js
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ invoices.js
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ invoices.new.js
  ```
  Not only does this make for a clear application structure in code. It also has huge performance benefits.
  When a route is requested the server can inject data into the component based on the request.
  When navigating to a nested route, the child route is rendered within the parent routes `<Outlet/>`.
  The component defined at the `/invoices` route provides a layout for both `/invoices/late` and `/invoices/2543`. 
  Navigating between the two sub routes is fast because the parent is already loaded and is just replacing the contents of its `<Outlet/>`.
- **Clear Code Splitting** - Nested routes become perfect boundaries for code splitting. 
  Each route is a component that is served behind a request. 
  Dependencies can be optimized and included at the route level or component level, whichever provides the best perceived performance.
  Most importantly, when a nested route is requested, each code chunk is requested simultaneously from the client. 
  The client receives the required chunks much faster and therefore renders the full page faster than a SPA.
- **Forms** - Form handling on SPA are kind of messy. Does `event.preventDefault()` sound familiar? With SSR you can write HTML forms the way they were intended.
  The event onSubmit has meaning again. Oh, and when you submit a form you are submitting a `POST` request back to the same route that the component was served from.
  Right above your component definition in remix you can define an `action()` to handle the request server side. 
  While that request is taking place you can use the  `useTransition` hook client side to update the UI based on the submission status.
- **Built In MDX Support** - A syntax that allows you to use JSX/React components within a markdown file.
  Great for adding interactivity or widgets within long form content. (Ideal for blogs and documentation!)
- **Error Boundaries** - An error component can be defined for each route. So if a panel in the dashboard had an error at least the rest of the UI will render just fine.
- **Scroll Restoration** - The scroll position is persisted between page refreshes.
- **Deployment Templates** - Remix can be deployed as an SSR or ESSR application. [Remix Deployment Types](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/deployment)

## It all sounds great, how hard is it to learn?
Existing React knowledge will benefit you greatly, but you are entering a different paradigm.
If you have only built CSR based apps before, some of the concepts will be totally new.
Routing and performance optimization might through you for a loop at first.
If you get stuck, Remix has pretty good documentation and the community is growing fast.

### üíÖ Styling
I'll be honest, there is a slight learning curve, in terms of CSS.
There is no built in support for CSS modules or CSS preprocessors. 
Adding a CSS preprocessor is simple enough, but Remix suggests rethinking your CSS.
TailwindCSS is the suggested tool to use for your CSS. 
I see the argument for using a utility first CSS framework, but I'm still skeptical.
It's on my todo list for things to explore.

Alternatively, you can use styled components. 
They claim it adds a little extra rendering overhead, but in this case productivity over performance might be worth it.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
If you choose to go the ESSR route, getting your CI/CD will seem weird at first. 
Each route is effectively converted into a serverless function which is defined differently for each cloud provider.
Remix gives you deployment templates for several different providers, but each cloud provider will most likely come with their own limitations.

## Still not convinced?
Here are some demos to showcase some cool things you can do with Remix and CloudFlare Workers.
This post was written in `.mdx` which allowed me to write the demos as react components
and include them in my markdown by referencing them inline, like `<CookiesDemo/>`.


### NFTs + üç™'s
The first time you fetched this page, you started a new session and 1 of 2 possible cookie value pairs were randomly chosen within a Cloudflare Worker.
**I didn't ask for your consent to accept cookies, but I'm not storing them. Here are the values.**

These are hexidecimal values used to lookup contracts on Ethereum.

> 1. `contract=0x0AE53C425F0725123205fd4CBDFB1Ac8240445cF8&tokenId=9264`
> 2. `contract=0x0AE53C425F0725123205fd4CBDFB1Ac8240445cF&tokenId=2558`

The value pair was then used to send a request to a dedicated Ethereum gateway API, (NFTPort).
Once the request to NFTPORT was complete, the Cloudflare Worker injected the contract meta data into the markup response and sent it back to you along with the cookie value.
_I could have passed the values to you and made you use your client side Ethereum provider, but browser wallets are a UX nightmare._

Check out which NFT was randomly chosen to be displayed!

> 1. When you refresh the page, the same NFT will be displayed.
> 2. When you click on the other option, you send a form request back to the server that sets your cookie server side, makes a request to NFTPort and returns the appropriate metadata.

<CookiesDemo />


### WebSockets > Polling
This is a simple example of a WebSocket. 

When you click on the button "Open WebSocket", your client attempts to create a new WebSocket at `joncrawford.me/web-socket`.
The `/web-socket` end point is not a Remix route, but a serverless cloudflare worker route. 
When it receives a request to open a websocket connection:
1. It establishes a connection with your client.
2. Then sends 5 messages at an interval of 500ms. (Where each message includes the request origin and the timestamp of the message.)
3. Then the connection is closed.


<WebSocketDemo/>

of the Remix framework.*
